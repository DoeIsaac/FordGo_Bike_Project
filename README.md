## Introduction

>This dataset was source from the Udacity Platform and is about individual rides of a bike sharing system covering the Greater San Francisco Bay Area for the month of Feburary 2019. The original dataset has 183,412 sample and 16 features. The goal of this project is to understand our users features and how we can improve our services to suit them.
We loaded the dataset and explore to get an understanding of the data. During the Data Cleaning stage, we uncovered some missing values, inappropriate data type and also created two new features from (birth_year) column to be able to analyze the age and age group of our users.

## Summary of Findings

>In the exploration, some insight we gather are:
We are having a greater percentage of Male to Female and other gender
The dataset population is mostly youth and young adults born between 1984-1995 compare to the older ones, and zero kids.
90% of users are subscribers and the remaining few are customers
Fewer bike trips were shared, meaning most user prefered riding alone
The young people have the tendency of riding longer than the older ones
Our hot spot pickup stations are those which id is lower than 200, for other gender we can find them mostly starting at stations which id is between 350-400
The average travel time is 704 seconds and both user types seems to have similar trend in their travel time

## Key Insight for Presentation

> For the Presentation, our main objective is to understand our users features and draw-up a campaign on how we can improve our services to suit our users. We intend to use this project learn about the categories of users we have eg: age group of users.
